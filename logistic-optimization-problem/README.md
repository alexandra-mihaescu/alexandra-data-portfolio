# Logistic Oprimization: Transportation Problem

This repository contains the solution to a logistic optimization problem that I had to develope during my Operations Research course.
The project focuses on minimising total transportation distance to supply military equipment from supply bases to client bases.

---

## Project Overview

The task consists of a linear programming problem where the goal is to determine **from which supply base each client base should be served** in order to minimize the total distance travelled.

Key elements of the project:

- Mathematical model formulation using **AMPL**
- Definition of decision variables and cpnstraints (capacity and assignment)
- Analysis of optimal solution and variations in supply and distance
- interpretation of the results in a real world logistics context

In particular, the project demonstrates skills in **problem structuring and reporting**.
