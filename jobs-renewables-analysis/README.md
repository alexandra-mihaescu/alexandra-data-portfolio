## Project Overview 

This project work investigates whether the expansion of **renewable energy production** contributes to **employment growth** in the European Union.
Using panel data for **27 EU countries from 2005 to 2023**, the study replicates and updates previous research, incorporating recent dynamics such as:
- The European Green Deal;
- Post-Covid labour market adjustments;

- Technological progress in wind, solar and other renewables.

The goal is to provide updated and policy relevant evidence on the job effects of the green transition.
